### Hi, I’m Cabin Zhu 👋

I'm currently a candidate of PhD @ HKU/CS. I used to be an intern at Apple for half a year in 2023.

- 🌱 My research focus on systems, machine learning and large-scale software development.
- 🛠️ I'm interested in automation tool development, for both work and daily life.
  
Welcome to use and give feedbacks on Vocab Manager📕, CV-Export and other tools I built :D
