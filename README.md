### Hi, I’m Cabin Zhu 👋

I'm a current PhD student @ HKU/CS.

- 🌱 My research focus on machine learning systems and large-scale software development.
- 🛠️ I'm interested in developing automation & visualization tools for both work and daily life.

Here are a few of the automation script tools I've crafted for my daily use, which may also be helpful to you:
- [Gym Track Visualizer (GViz)](https://github.com/cabinz/gym-track-visualizer)
- [Easy Trip Split](https://github.com/cabinz/easy-trip-split)
- [CV Export](https://github.com/cabinz/CV-Export)

Feel free to check these projects out and share your thoughts. Your feedback is invaluable to me! 😊🚀
